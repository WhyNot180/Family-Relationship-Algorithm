# Family-Relationship-Algorithm
## Description

This project is an algorithm that will find the relationships between two family members in a family tree.

## Objectives
* Create an algorithm that will always get the correct relationship between two family members
* Have a time complexity of O(n log n) or faster
* Have a space complexity no larger than O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Display a list of family members to choose from
* Display the relationship between two selected members
